# YOLOv5s Vehicle Detection Project

## Introduction
Welcome to our university lab project repository, where we explore vehicle detection using the YOLOv5s model. This project is designed to help students understand the architecture of YOLOv5s, fine-tune parameters, and train the model using various datasets.

## Objectives
- **Understand YOLOv5s Architecture**: Dive deep into the YOLOv5s architecture and its components.
- **Dataset Analysis**: Work with multiple datasets to understand challenges in vehicle detection from a top view.
- **Model Training**: Fine-tune YOLOv5s parameters and train the model to detect vehicles accurately.
- **Evaluation**: Assess the model's performance and identify areas for improvement.

## YOLOv5s Overview
YOLOv5s is the smallest variant of the YOLOv5 model series designed for real-time object detection, balancing speed and accuracy. It is particularly suited for applications where computational resources are limited.

## Datasets
We will be using the following datasets for our project:
- **Dataset1**: [Link or description]
- **Dataset2**: [Link or description]
- **Dataset3**: [Link or description]

Each dataset has been chosen to provide a range of challenges, from varying vehicle sizes to different urban and rural scenes.
